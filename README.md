# What I learned
Starting development from mobile first helps make the website more responsive from the get-go.
I learned about Sass for the first time and found it to be much more powerful than CSS.
Using scss files is optimal for partitioning your code to keep it more organized.
For example, putting variables and  general code in a separate file. You can also 
put media queries in a separate file.
The scss file that you write your code in is compiled into a CSS file which you link to your HTML file.
The scss file that is going to get compiled is the file where you are going to import all of the partitioned 
scss files. Also when you name the partioned scss files make sure that they have an underscore in the beginning
of the name so that they are not compiled.
